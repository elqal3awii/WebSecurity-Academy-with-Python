1. Change the URL of the lab
2. Change the domain of the burp collaborator
3. Start script

```
~$ python main.py
```

## Expected Output

⦗#⦘ Injection point: TrackingId
❯❯ Injecting payload to make a DNS lookup.. OK
🗹 Check the DNS lookup in your burp collaborator
🗹 The lab should be marked now as solved
```
